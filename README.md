# nanogpt-lecture

Code created in the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series, specifically on the first lecture on nanoGPT. Publishing here as a Github repo so people can easily hack it, walk through the `git log` history of it, etc.

NOTE: The current code will train and work fine, but its convergence is relatively slow because it starts off in a not great spot in the weight space. To improve weight init, please see [nanoGPT model.py](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/master/model.py) for `# init all weights` comment, and especially how it calls the `_init_weights` function.
